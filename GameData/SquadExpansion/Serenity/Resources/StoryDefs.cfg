// The stories are made up of three sections: the introduction, problem statement and conclusion.  Logic will internally be used to select one string from each
// section and combine them to make up the backstory.  The strings support replacement tags (the bits inside [brackets]).  These will be replaced when rendering
// text for another line, taken from the node which matches the name in the tag.
//
// Special Tags
//  [Agency] Replaced by the given agency that takes part in the story
//  [Topic] Replaced by the given topic for the story. This will always be a singular noun, like a place or a Kerbal, a part title, or an object of interest
